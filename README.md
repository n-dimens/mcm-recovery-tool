# Minecraft Mod Recovery Tool

A tool to restore the source code of mods, if the source code was lost, or there is no way to contact the author of the mod. Founded and inspired by the project [Minecraft Deobfuscator](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-tools/2849175-minecraft-deobfuscator-2019-update-deobfuscation),
thank you [Z-Doctor](https://github.com/Z-Doctor) for the work done.

Uses disassembler [FernFlower](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/FernFlower.git).
